# Recession Forecasting

## Overview

**Recession Forecasting** is a predictive modeling project that leverages economic and behavioral indicators to forecast U.S. recessions. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset compiled from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) platform, spanning from 1977 to 2023. The process involves forecasting economic and behavioral indicators using an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model, followed by applying a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of recession.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered quarterly economic and behavioral indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) platform for the years 1977 to 2023.
- **ARMA Model**: Trained an ARMA model to project future values of economic and behavioral indicators for the next five years.
- **Recession Prediction**: Built and trained a Random Forest Classifier using projected indicators to predict recessionary periods.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved 96.8% test accuracy and 100% recall with the Random Forest Classifier, ensuring high precision in identifying recessionary periods.
